Data

NCRB brings out three annual reports i.e. Crime in India, Accidental Deaths & Suicides in India and Prison  Statistics India. These reports are principal reference points for police officers, researchers, media& policy makers. This map draws data from the Crime in India Reports for the Year 2018, 2017 and 2016.
